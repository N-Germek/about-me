      <h2>What Have I learned?</h2>
        <p>
            My skillsets have evolved over the years and as a result, so has my schools and my degrees.  I have studied an AS in Accounting through Colorado Technical College also an AS in Business Administration and Management with a minor in Accountingmy through St. Petersburg college in Florida. Though neither degrees were completed, the life lessons in budgeting, time management and staying focused have all led to my understanding of self discipline in all of the above as well as life in general.

        <h3>How did I get to where I am now?</h3>
        <p>
        My experience in customer service as a Barista starting up at Starbucks, multitasking initially learned from my work in McDonalds, sales and advising from finance has led me to where I am at as a Financial Center Manager, Market Training Mentor and co Leader to four other centers for Bank of America.  I've learned to tailor the experience for my trainees for maximum retention and understanding. My experience as a mentor for numerous individuals and leaders allowed me the opportunity to become a member of our Employee Engagement and Inclusion Council.

        <h4>I'm an Advocate</h4>
        <p>
            Weather I advocate for one of my clients, one of my trainees or one of my peers, my mission if simple, help where I can, teach who I can and learn what I can. Acting as an advocate for my clients means being able to understand their needs, goals and problem solve through the eyes of someone outside the industry. Advcating for my trainees means taking the time to learn how they best learn and retain information and tailoring the experience to the specific needs of that individual. Advocating for my peers, means showing them through my own confidence and openness that it is not only great, but it is accepted to be able to bring your whole self to work or any venue you find yourself in.
